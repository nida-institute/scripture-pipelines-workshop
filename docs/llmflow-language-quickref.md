# Scripture Pipelines Language Quick Reference

This file is a compact, self-contained reference to the Scripture Pipelines
pipeline language for day-to-day work in this repository.

If you have access to the engine repo, the full specification lives
in `docs/sp-language.md` there, but this quickref is designed to
be enough to author and review pipelines on its own.

## 1. Pipeline structure

```yaml
name: my_pipeline
description: |
  One-line or multi-line description of what this flow does.

variables:
  output_dir: "outputs"

llm_config:
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  max_tokens: 1024
  temperature: 0.2

linter_config:
  enabled: true
  treat_warnings_as_errors: true

steps:
  - name: first-step
    type: llm          # or any other step type — see below
    # ...
```

This file covers the step types most pipelines use. **The complete list** — every step type,
every key it accepts, and every `sp` command with its options — is `docs/cli-api.json` in this
project. It is generated from the engine itself, so it is always current.

Key sections:

- `name`, `description`: human-readable name and summary for the flow.
- `variables`: global variables available to all steps.
- `llm_config`: default model parameters for `llm` steps.
- `linter_config`: controls validation behavior for this pipeline.
- `steps`: ordered list of operations that make up the flow.

## 2. Referencing variables and templates

In pipeline YAML, use `${var}` syntax to reference variables and
step outputs:

- `${output_dir}` – root-level variable.
- `${greeting}` – value produced by a previous step.
- `${scene.WLC}` – field access on an object.
- `${scene_list[0]}` – first element of a list.
- `${scene_list[-1]}` – last element of a list.
- `${scene_list[-1].field}` – field on the last element.
- `${scene_list[0].field}` – field on the first element.
- `${scene_list[:-1]}` – every element except the last.
- `${scene_list[-10:]}` – last 10 elements (returns all if fewer than 10).
- `${scene_list[*].Title}` – extract one field from every item; returns a flat list.
- `${scene_list[-3:][*].Title}` – field from each of the last 3 items.

In prompt and template files (`*.gpt`, `*.md`), use `{{var}}` — and **only flat names**:

- `{{language_count}}`
- `{{greeting_markdown}}`

**`{{scene.WLC}}` is not valid, even though `${scene.WLC}` is.** The two syntaxes are not
symmetrical: `${...}` resolves a path through an object, while `{{...}}` is filled by matching
its name against a literal key of the context — and `scene.WLC` is not a key, so nothing fills
it. Field access belongs on the pipeline side: pass the value in under a flat name.

```yaml
prompt:
  file: analyse.gpt
  inputs:
    wlc_text: "${scene.WLC}"      # the path is resolved here …
```

```
Analyse {{wlc_text}}.                # … and the prompt names the result
```

Both `sp lint` and `sp run` refuse a dotted name in a prompt body rather than sending the model
an unfilled placeholder.

Prompt files usually include a small contract (often in a comment
block) that documents which inputs they expect (`requires`). Every
one of them is required — see "There is no `optional:` key" below —
so make sure the pipeline step provides each via `prompt.inputs`.

## 3. Common step types

### type: `llm`

Runs a prompt through an LLM and stores the response.

```yaml
- name: generate_text
  type: llm
  prompt:
    file: "template.gpt"
    inputs:
      topic: "${topic}"
  output: draft
  saveas:
    path: "${output_dir}/draft.md"
```

- `prompt.file` points to a prompt in `prompts/`.
- `prompt.inputs` provides values that the prompt template expects.
- `output` names the variable that will hold the LLM response.
- `saveas.path` writes that response to disk.

Optional extras you may see:

- `output_type: json` – ask the engine to parse the response as JSON.
- `log: debug` – per-step log level.

### type: `function`

Calls a Python function as part of the flow.

```yaml
- name: parse_data
  type: function
  function: some.module:callable
  inputs:
    raw: "${raw_text}"
  output: parsed
  saveas:
    path: "${output_dir}/parsed.json"
```

Use `function` steps for deterministic utilities: parsing, loading
files, rendering templates, reshaping JSON, etc.

### type: `for-each`

Loops over a list variable and runs nested steps for each item.

```yaml
- name: process_each_item
  type: for-each
  for: item
  in: "${items}"
  parallel: 4                      # optional: run up to 4 iterations concurrently
  group_by: "${item.category}"     # optional: group results by this field
  order_by: "${item.sequence}"     # optional: sort results within groups
  steps:
    - name: handle-item
      type: llm
      prompt:
        file: "item.gpt"
        inputs:
          item_text: "${item}"
      output: item_result
      append_to: all_results
```

- `for` is the name used to refer to each element (XQuery-style: `for $x in $list`).
- `in` points to the list value.
- Use `append_to` in nested steps to build a list across iterations.
- `parallel: N` runs N iterations concurrently; results are collected in
  input order regardless. Omit for sequential execution (default).
- `group_by` and `order_by` accept `${expr}` expressions evaluated against
  each item. `group_by` groups `append_to` results by the expression value;
  `order_by` sorts within each group.

### type: `window`

Slides over a list in overlapping or tumbling windows, running nested
steps on each slice. Useful when a list is too large to process at once.

```yaml
- name: segment_by_windows
  type: window
  for: window_content
  in: "${content_list}"
  size: 50                   # fixed: 50 items per window
  # or: size_by_tokens: 4000 # token-aware: ~4000 tokens per window
  include_partial: true      # include the last partial window
  steps:
    - name: process_window
      type: llm
      prompt:
        file: "process.gpt"
        inputs:
          chunk: "${window_content}"
      output: window_result
      append_to: all_results

    # Optional: dynamic cursor — tell the engine where the next window starts.
    # Without this, windows advance by the full size (tumbling / non-overlapping).
    #
    # Two halves, and half is worse than none:
    #   1. DISCARD the last logical unit of a non-final window. The physical cut may
    #      have truncated it, so its end is not known. The next window re-decides it.
    #   2. RESUME from the trailing edge of the last unit you KEPT — never from the
    #      opening of the unit you dropped. If the model left a gap between them, a
    #      cursor set to the dropped unit's opening skips it and nothing sees it again.
    # The final window keeps everything: nothing truncated it.
    - !window_advance
      name: advance_cursor
      cursor: next_start      # a LIST INDEX into `in:` — not a domain identifier
      step:
        name: compute_next
        type: function
        function: plugins.windowing.content_index_of_sid
        inputs:
          # [-2] is the last unit kept, because [-1] was discarded as possibly cut.
          # Its trailing edge, not its opening.
          verse_sid: "${window_result.pericopes[-2].first_verse_sid_after_pericope}"
          content: "${content_list}"
          # A domain boundary has to be converted to a position; that is all this
          # function does.
        output: next_start
```

- `size` — fixed item count per window. Required even in cursor mode, where it bounds
  how far each window may reach.
- `size_by_tokens` — token-aware; requires `model` key (inherits from `llm_config`).
- `include_partial: true` — process the final window even if it is shorter than `size`.
- `!window_advance` — when present, switches to dynamic (cursor-driven) mode.
  The inner `step` runs each iteration; if its `cursor` variable is `null`
  the loop stops after the current window.
- Two guards, both raising rather than misbehaving: a cursor that is not a non-negative
  integer is rejected, and a cursor that does not advance beyond the current start raises
  instead of looping forever.
- Use `size`/`stride` when list items are independent (summarise every 10 reviews); use a
  cursor whenever the LLM is finding structure *inside* the block. See "Physical windows,
  logical units" in the Scripture Pipelines language reference for why.

### Cross-iteration state in `for-each` and `window`

Each iteration starts from a **fresh copy of the outer context**. Variables set
inside an iteration are not automatically visible to the next one — unless they
are propagated out via `output` or `append_to`.

**`output` (last-iteration-wins):** the final value written by each iteration
replaces the outer variable. Each subsequent iteration sees the updated value.

**`append_to` (accumulating list):** each iteration appends to a list in the
outer context. Subsequent iterations see the growing list — including the items
appended by earlier iterations. This enables "rolling context" patterns:

```yaml
- name: analyze_pericopes
  type: for-each
  for: pericope
  in: "${leaf_pericopes}"
  steps:
    - name: analyze
      type: llm
      prompt:
        file: analyze.gpt
        inputs:
          passage: "${pericope.canonical_reference}"
          # Only pass the last 10 summaries — prior_pericopes grows each iteration
          prior_context: "${prior_pericopes[-10:]}"
      output: pericope_analysis

    - name: summarize
      type: function
      function: plugins.summaries.pick_fields   # your own, under plugins/
      inputs:
        obj: "${pericope_analysis}"
        fields: ["title", "themes"]
      output: summary
      append_to: prior_pericopes   # visible to next iteration
```

The slice `${prior_pericopes[-10:]}` always returns the last 10 items,
or all items if fewer than 10 have accumulated so far.

### type: `scripture`

Fetch one passage from one **named** resource. The name resolves through
`~/.sp/registrations/*.yaml`, so no path appears in a pipeline and the same
pipeline runs on any machine.

```yaml
- name: fetch_source
  type: scripture
  resource: SBLGNT             # a registered resource
  passage: "${passage}"       # MRK · MRK 1 · MRK 1:1 · MRK 1:1-8 · MRK 1:40-2:12
  format: milestones          # plain | milestones | usj  (default: milestones)
  versification: eng          # optional — the scheme `passage` is written in
  include: [ids, discourse]   # optional — valid with every format
  output: source_text
```

**`output:` names members.** A `scripture` step has two: `text`, the passage,
which is primary, and `reference`, what the engine parsed out of `passage`. A
bare name binds `text`; a list names members, each optionally renamed as
`variable=member`:

```yaml
  output: source_text                                  # the passage
  output: [source_text=text, passage_info=reference]   # the passage, and its parsed reference
```

Which members exist is declared by **the step type** — `alignment` and
`parallel-passages` have their own, and a `function` step has none, so do not
carry these names from one step type to another. `sp lint` refuses a member
the step type does not declare.

The `reference` member is what the engine parsed out of `passage`
before fetching it: `book_code`, `book_name`, `chapter`, `start_verse`,
`end_verse`, `testament`, `original_language`, `canonical_reference`,
`display_name`, `filename_prefix`, and the four versification fields. It is
parsed in this step's `versification:` if one is given, otherwise `eng` — so the
same `passage` string can yield two different `passage_info` objects in one
pipeline, which is correct and worth knowing.

Use it so nothing downstream re-parses a reference the engine has already read:

```yaml
- name: subject
  type: scripture
  resource: SBLGNT
  passage: "${passage}"
  output: [subject=text, passage_info=reference]

- name: english
  type: scripture
  resource: BSB
  passage: "${passage}"
  versification: org
  output: english
  saveas: "${output_dir}/${passage_info.filename_prefix}-english.txt"
```

**Three rules that bite:**

- **The member decides meaning, not the order.** `[passage_info=reference,
  subject=text]` binds exactly the same as the example above; a name without `=`
  must itself be a member (`text` or `reference`).
- **Declare it on an earlier step than the one that uses it.** A step's own
  `saveas` cannot name its own output — the linter adds a step's outputs to the
  available set after checking that step.
- **A member nobody names is not produced.** Name `reference` only on the step
  whose parse you want.

**Formats.** `plain` is running text. `milestones` adds `⌊1:1⌋` markers and
costs 1.072x — it is the default and usually enough. `usj` returns a **dict**,
2.56x in codepoints and 6.74x as escaped JSON, so pay for it only when
something consumes the structure. Verses are milestones, never containers:
do not restructure the text into a list or dict keyed by verse.

**Versification.** A reference is not a location until a scheme is named:
`PSA 51:1` is `PSA 51:3` in the original and `PSA 50:3` in the Vulgate.
`versification:` names the scheme *your* `passage` is written in; the engine
maps it before reading any text. A resource's own scheme comes from its
registry entry, a Paratext project's settings, or the shipped table — there is
no global default, and asking to cross schemes without one is an error.

**`include`** delivers analyses under one key, `scripture_pipelines`, which a
consumer can strip to get standard USJ. Eight families, all built: `ids`,
`morphology`, `senses`, `glosses`, `referents`, `discourse`, `syntax`,
`frequency`. Every family except `ids` needs `ids` beside it, because analyses
are keyed by word id; asking for one alone is an error. `discourse` and `syntax`
also need a path on the resource's registration — without it the family is
`null` with a warning. `frequency` gives each word its lemma's `count` in the
corpus (GNT for `SBLGNT`, HOT for `WLC`) and `in_least_frequent_percent`, from
tables the engine ships. `ids` becomes `srcloc` on each word.
`discourse` attaches Levinsohn's features at word ids, each carrying an
`outcome` — his indices are NA28-family and the text is SBLGNT, so a
disagreement is reported rather than silently resolved.

### type: `save`

Writes literal content to disk without calling an LLM.

```yaml
- name: write-confirmation
  type: save
  content: |
    ✅ Scripture Pipelines is installed and running.
    2 + 2 = ${total}
  saveas:
    path: "${output_dir}/confirmation.md"
```

Use `save` when you just need to materialize a small message or
artifact from existing variables.

### type: `if`

Conditionally executes a block of steps.

```yaml
- name: add-detail
  type: if
  condition: "${include_detail}"
  steps:
    - name: generate-detail
      type: llm
      prompt:
        file: "detail.gpt"
        inputs:
          topic: "${topic}"
      output: detail_text
```

- `condition` is evaluated first; if falsy the whole block is skipped.
- Any step type is valid in the nested `steps:` list.

### Step-level `condition:` (skip guard)

Any step (any type) can be skipped individually:

```yaml
- name: optional-step
  type: llm
  condition: "${run_optional}"
  prompt:
    file: "optional.gpt"
    inputs:
      data: "${data}"
  output: optional_result
```

The expression follows the same rules as `type: if` — variable reference,
Python eval expression, or boolean literal.

## 4. Saving outputs with `saveas`

Any step can write its primary output (or literal content) to a file:

```yaml
- name: save_report
  type: llm
  prompt:
    file: "report.gpt"
    inputs:
      data: "${analysis}"
  output: report_md
  saveas:
    path: "${output_dir}/report.md"
```

Notes:

- Parent directories are created automatically.
- You can include `${variables}` and nested fields inside the path.
- If you need multiple files, add more steps, each with its own
  `saveas`.

## 5. Running and linting pipelines

From the project root (where `pipelines/` lives):

```bash
sp run --pipeline pipelines/my-pipeline.yaml
```

To pass variables from the CLI:

```bash
sp run --pipeline pipelines/my-pipeline.yaml   --var passage="Psalm 23"   --var output_dir="outputs"
```

To validate a pipeline without running it:

```bash
sp lint --pipeline pipelines/my-pipeline.yaml
```

The `linter_config` block in the pipeline controls how strict
validation should be (for example, whether warnings become errors).

## 6. Prompt file format (`.gpt`)

Every `.gpt` file must begin with a YAML frontmatter header that declares
the variables it expects. The linter enforces this contract.

```
---
prompt:
  requires:
    - passage
  format: Markdown
  description: Brief description of what this prompt does.
---
# WHAT THIS STEP PRODUCES
...
```

Everything after the header is sent to the model as written, and its `#`
sections follow one order, which `sp lint` checks and warns on. A complete
prompt in that order is `prompts/readers-guide.gpt`, from the starter example `sp init`
writes — copy its shape. `sp lint` prints the full order beside its first
warning.

Key rules:

- **The header opens on the first line with `---`** and closes with `---`. The
  old `<!-- ... -->` header form is withdrawn; `sp lint` and `sp run` refuse it.
- `requires:` — list of variable names the caller *must* provide via `prompt.inputs`.
- **There is no `optional:` key.** Every prompt parameter is required. `sp lint` and `sp run`
  both refuse a header that declares it. Where a prompt genuinely reads differently with and
  without some context, that is a branch in the pipeline — two prompts, or a `condition:` on the
  step — not a hidden condition inside the prompt.
- Variables in the body use `{{double_braces}}`, and only flat names.
- If `requires:` is missing, the linter cannot validate the contract and will
  emit warnings about undeclared inputs.

### Mixins — shared text across prompts

```
{{mixin:mixins/output-language.md}}
```

The directive is replaced by the whole of the named file before anything else
happens to the prompt. The path is relative to the prompt file. Shared mixins
usually live in `prompts/mixins/`, as plain Markdown with no header.

- **Variables inside a mixin go in the prompt's `requires:`.** The directive is
  not a variable, but the prompt is checked with its mixins expanded, so a
  `{{language}}` in the mixin needs `language` declared.
- **A mixin naming a file that does not exist is an error**, in `sp lint` and
  in `sp run`.
